Overview
The is a Python class that combines multiple APIs to provide real-time transcription, text-to-speech, and AI-driven conversation capabilities. It uses the following services:

AssemblyAI for real-time transcription.
ElevenLabs for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis.
OpenAI for generating AI responses.
This project allows you to transcribe spoken words into text, generate responses using OpenAI's language model, and convert those responses into speech using ElevenLabs' TTS service.

Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure that you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
assemblyai library
elevenlabs library
openai library
pyaudio (for microphone input)
You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install assemblyai elevenlabs openai pyaudio
Setup
API Keys: Replace the placeholders for the API keys in the code with your actual API keys.

Imports: Ensure the necessary libraries are imported at the beginning of your script:

import assemblyai as aai
from elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs
from elevenlabs import stream
import openai
Client Initialization: Initialize the ElevenLabs client with your API key:

client = ElevenLabs(api_key="your_elevenlabs_api_key")
Creating an AI Assistant Instance: Create an instance of the AI_Assistant class:

ai_assistant = AI_Assistant()
Generating Greeting Audio: Generate an audio greeting using the generate_audio method:

greeting = "Thank you for taking me as your assistant, what's your name?"
ai_assistant.generate_audio(greeting)
Starting Transcription: Start the real-time transcription process:

ai_assistant.start_transcription()
How It Works
Real-Time Transcription: The start_transcription method initiates the transcription process using AssemblyAI's RealtimeTranscriber. The transcriber listens to audio input from the microphone and generates text.

AI Response Generation: When a final transcript is received, the generate_ai_response method sends the transcribed text to OpenAI's language model to generate a response.

Text-to-Speech Synthesis: The generated response is then passed to the generate_audio method, which uses ElevenLabs to convert the text response into speech.

Streaming Audio: The speech is streamed back to the user in real-time.
